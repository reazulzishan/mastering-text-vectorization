# Mastering Text Vectorization 🚀

This repository showcases a comprehensive deep dive into **Text Vectorization** techniques in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. It covers the journey from basic categorical encoding to advanced semantic word embeddings.



## 📌 Overview
In NLP, machines don't understand text; they understand numbers. This project demonstrates the fundamental methods used to transform unstructured text into numerical vectors that Machine Learning models can process.

## 🛠️ Techniques Implemented

### 1. One-Hot Encoding
- Representing categorical data as binary vectors.
- Useful for small, discrete datasets.

### 2. Bag of Words (BoW) & N-Grams
- Capturing word frequency and sequence context.
- Implementation using `CountVectorizer` from Scikit-learn.

### 3. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- Weighing word importance by penalizing common words and highlighting unique ones.
- Ideal for text classification and search tasks.



### 4. Word2Vec (Word Embeddings)
- Leveraging deep learning to capture **semantic meaning**.
- Explored **CBOW** and **Skip-gram** architectures.
- Visualizing word relationships using **Gensim** and **NLTK**.
